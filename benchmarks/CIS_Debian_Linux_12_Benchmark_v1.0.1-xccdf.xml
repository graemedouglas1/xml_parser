      <xhtml:p>This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for *Debian Linux 12 running on x86_64 platforms.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>This guide was developed and tested against Debian Linux 12.5</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>
The guidance within broadly assumes that operations are being performed as the       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 user, and executed under the default Bash version for the applicable distribution. Operations performed using       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sudo</xhtml:span>
 instead of the       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 user, or executed under another shell, may produce unexpected results, or fail to make the intended changes to the system. Non-root users may not be able to access certain areas of the system, especially after remediation has been performed. It is advisable to verify       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 users path integrity and the integrity of any programs being run prior to execution of commands and scripts included in this benchmark.    </xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>
The default prompt for the       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 user is       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">#</xhtml:span>
, and as such all sample commands will have       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">#</xhtml:span>
 as an additional indication that it is to be executed as       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>

   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

               <xhtml:p>A number of uncommon filesystem types are supported under Linux. Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them, especially in light of frequent operating system changes.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less attractive.</xhtml:p>

: This should not be considered a comprehensive list of filesystems. You may wish to consider additions to those listed here for your environment.

Kernel modules loaded directly via             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">insmod</xhtml:span>

Using             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/bin/false</xhtml:span>
 as the command in disabling a particular module serves two purposes; to convey the meaning of the entry to the user and cause a non-zero return value. The latter can be tested for in scripts. Please note that             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">insmod</xhtml:span>
 will ignore what is configured in the relevant             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/modprobe.d/*.conf</xhtml:span>

 application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their software's end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ("App store"), can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for upstream software deployment.                  </xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for system operations.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be performed before repartitioning the system.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>

 you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed (This may require the system to be in single-user mode):          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>
Mount the new partition to a temporary mountpoint e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount /dev/sda2 /mnt</xhtml:span>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Copy data from the original partition to the new partition. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">cp -a /var/tmp/* /mnt</xhtml:span>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Verify that all data is present on the new partition. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ls -la /mnt</xhtml:span>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Unmount the new partition. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umount /mnt</xhtml:span>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Remove the data from the original directory that was in the old partition. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rm -Rf /var/tmp/*</xhtml:span>
 Otherwise it will still consume space in the old partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted.            </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Mount the new partition to the desired mountpoint. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount /dev/sda2 /var/tmp</xhtml:span>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
Update               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/fstab</xhtml:span>
 with the new mountpoint. e.g.               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/dev/sda2  /var/tmp  xfs   defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0</xhtml:span>

Example of using                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>

                           <xhtml:p>Example of using a volume or disk with specific mount options. The source location of the volume or disk will vary depending on your environment:</xhtml:p>

                           <xhtml:p>
                              <xhtml:p>
By design files saved to                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the system.                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 is ram based and all files stored to                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 will be lost when the system is rebooted.                    </xhtml:p>
                              <xhtml:p>
If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/tmp</xhtml:span>
 not                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
.                    </xhtml:p>
                              <xhtml:p>
Since the                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 or a separate partition.                    </xhtml:p>
                              <xhtml:p>
Running out of                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 (as with                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than                       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 which is RAM-based.                    </xhtml:p>

When modifying                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the data over before returning to multi-user mode.                </xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>
The reasoning for mounting                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 on a separate partition is as follows.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:h4>Protection from resource exhaustion</xhtml:h4>
                     <xhtml:p>
The default installation only creates a single                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. Since the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 directory contains user generated data, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 and impact all local users.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:h4>Fine grained control over the mount</xhtml:h4>
                     <xhtml:p>
Configuring                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec/nosuid/nodev</xhtml:span>
. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. In the case of                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 options such as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">usrquota/grpquota</xhtml:span>
 may be considered to limit the impact that users can have on each other with regards to disk resource exhaustion. Other options allow for specific behavior. See                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man mount</xhtml:span>
 for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:h4>Protection of user data</xhtml:h4>
                     <xhtml:p>
As                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 contains user data, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point.              </xhtml:p>

When modifying                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the data over before returning to multi-user mode.                </xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>
The reasoning for mounting                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 on a separate partition is as follows.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:h4>Protection from resource exhaustion</xhtml:h4>
                     <xhtml:p>
The default installation only creates a single                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. Since the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 and cause unintended behavior across the system as the disk is full. See                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man auditd.conf</xhtml:span>
 for details.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:h4>Fine grained control over the mount</xhtml:h4>
                     <xhtml:p>
Configuring                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec/nosuid/nodev</xhtml:span>
. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man mount</xhtml:span>
 for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:h4>Protection from exploitation</xhtml:h4>
                     <xhtml:p>
An example of exploiting                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">setuid</xhtml:span>
 program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard-link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.              </xhtml:p>

When modifying                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/tmp</xhtml:span>
 it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the data over before returning to multi-user mode.                </xhtml:p>

When modifying                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log</xhtml:span>
 it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the data over before returning to multiuser mode.                </xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>
The reasoning for mounting                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log</xhtml:span>
 on a separate partition is as follows.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:h4>Protection from resource exhaustion</xhtml:h4>
                     <xhtml:p>
The default installation only creates a single                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. Since the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log</xhtml:span>
 directory contains log files which can grow quite large, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:h4>Fine grained control over the mount</xhtml:h4>
                     <xhtml:p>
Configuring                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log</xhtml:span>
 as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec/nosuid/nodev</xhtml:span>
. These options limit an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man mount</xhtml:span>
 for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:h4>Protection of log data</xhtml:h4>
                     <xhtml:p>
As                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log</xhtml:span>
 contains log files, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point.              </xhtml:p>

When modifying                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit</xhtml:span>
 it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the data over before returning to multi-user mode.                </xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>
The reasoning for mounting                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit</xhtml:span>
 on a separate partition is as follows.              </xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:h4>Protection from resource exhaustion</xhtml:h4>
                     <xhtml:p>
The default installation only creates a single                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. Since the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit</xhtml:span>

Configuring                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit</xhtml:span>
 as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec/nosuid/nodev</xhtml:span>
. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man mount</xhtml:span>

Large enterprises may choose to install a local updates server that can be used in place of their distributions servers, whereas a single deployment of a system may prefer to get updates directly. Updates can be performed automatically or manually, depending on the site's policy for patch management. Organizations may prefer to test patches against their environment on a non-production system before rolling out to production.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Mandatory Access Control (MAC) provides an additional layer of access restrictions to processes on top of the base Discretionary Access Controls. By restricting how processes can access files and resources on a system the potential impact from vulnerabilities in the processes can be reduced.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>Impact:</xhtml:strong>
 Mandatory Access Control limits the capabilities of applications and daemons on a system, while this can prevent unauthorized access the configuration of MAC can be complex and difficult to implement correctly preventing legitimate access from occurring.        </xhtml:p>

            <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
               <xhtml:p>AppArmor provides a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that greatly augments the default Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model. Under AppArmor MAC rules are applied by file paths instead of by security contexts as in other MAC systems. As such it does not require support in the filesystem and can be applied to network mounted filesystems for example. AppArmor security policies define what system resources applications can access and what privileges they can do so with. This automatically limits the damage that the software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions must be satisfied as well as the AppArmor MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, AppArmor rules can only make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure.</xhtml:p>

Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. It is important that the organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific.

         <xhtml:p>While applying system updates and patches helps correct known vulnerabilities, one of the best ways to protect the system against as yet unreported vulnerabilities is to disable all services that are not required for normal system operation. This prevents the exploitation of vulnerabilities discovered at a later date. If a service is not enabled, it cannot be exploited. The actions in this section of the document provide guidance on some services which can be safely disabled and under which circumstances, greatly reducing the number of possible threats to the resulting system. Additionally, some services which should remain enabled but with secure configuration are covered as well as insecure service clients.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:span class="inline_block">systemd-timesyncd</xhtml:span>
 is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group "systemd-timesync" needs to be created on installation of systemd.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults. Initially, the main configuration file in /etc/systemd/ contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can be created by editing this file or by creating drop-ins, as described below. Using drop-ins for local configuration is recommended over modifications to the main configuration file.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
In addition to the "main" configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets are read from             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/</xhtml:span>
,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/</xhtml:span>
, and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/systemd/*.conf.d/</xhtml:span>
. Those drop-ins have higher precedence and override the main configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the files.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the configuration directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">crontab</xhtml:span>
 is the program used to install, deinstall, or list the tables used to drive the cron daemon. Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/spool/cron/crontabs</xhtml:span>
, they are not intended to be edited directly.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
If the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.allow</xhtml:span>
 file exists, then you must be listed (one user per line) therein in order to be allowed to use this command. If the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.allow</xhtml:span>
 file does not exist but the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.deny</xhtml:span>
 file does exist, then you must not be listed in the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.deny</xhtml:span>
 file in order to use this command.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be able to use this command.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
If both files exist then               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.allow</xhtml:span>
 takes precedence. Which means that               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.deny</xhtml:span>
 is not considered and your user must be listed in               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.allow</xhtml:span>
 in order to be able to use the crontab.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Regardless of the existence of any of these files, the root administrative user is always allowed to setup a crontab.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
The files               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.allow</xhtml:span>
 and               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.deny</xhtml:span>
, if they exist, must be either world-readable, or readable by group               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">crontab</xhtml:span>
. If they are not, then cron will deny access to all users until the permissions are fixed.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
There is one file for each user's crontab under the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/spool/cron/crontabs</xhtml:span>
 directory. Users are not allowed to edit the files under that directory directly to ensure that only users allowed by the system to run periodic tasks can add them, and only syntactically correct crontabs will be written there. This is enforced by having the directory writable only by the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">crontab</xhtml:span>
 group and configuring crontab command with the setgid bid set for that specific group.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>

                  <xhtml:ul>
                     <xhtml:li>
Even though a given user is not listed in                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">cron.allow</xhtml:span>
, cron jobs can still be run as that user              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
The files                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.allow</xhtml:span>
 and                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/cron.deny</xhtml:span>
, if they exist, only controls administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron jobs              </xhtml:li>

On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">cron</xhtml:span>
 jobs. Using the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">cron.allow</xhtml:span>

 allows fairly complex time specifications, extending the POSIX.2 standard. It accepts times of the form HH:MM to run a job at a specific time of day. (If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.) You may also specify midnight, noon, or teatime (4pm) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the morning or the evening. You can also say what day the job will be run, by giving a date in the form month-name day with an optional year, or giving a date of the form MMDD[CC]YY, MM/DD/[CC]YY,  DD.MM.[CC]YY or [CC]YY-MM-DD. The specification of a date must follow the specification of the time of day. You can also give times like now + count time-units, where the time-units can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell at to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow.            </xhtml:p>

 files determine which user can submit commands for later execution via at or batch. The format of the files is a list of usernames, one on each line. Whitespace is not permitted. If the file               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/at.allow</xhtml:span>
 exists, only usernames mentioned in it are allowed to use at. If               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/at.allow</xhtml:span>
 does not exist,               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/at.deny</xhtml:span>
 is checked, every username not mentioned in it is then allowed to use at. An empty               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/at.deny</xhtml:span>
 means that every user may use at. If neither file exists, only the superuser is allowed to use at.            </xhtml:p>

 forces the Linux kernel to utilize reverse path filtering on a received packet to determine if the packet was valid. Essentially, with reverse path filtering, if the return packet does not go out the same interface that the corresponding source packet came from, the packet is dropped (and logged if             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">log_martians</xhtml:span>

 is a good way to deter attackers from sending your system bogus packets that cannot be responded to. One instance where this feature breaks down is if asymmetrical routing is employed. This would occur when using dynamic routing protocols (bgp, ospf, etc) on your system. If you are using asymmetrical routing on your system, you will not be able to enable this feature without breaking the routing.          </xhtml:p>

 disables the system from accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing.          </xhtml:p>

When             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tcp_syncookies</xhtml:span>
 is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue.          </xhtml:p>

         <xhtml:p>A firewall is a set of rules. When a data packet moves into or out of a protected network space, its contents (in particular, information about its origin, target, and the protocol it plans to use) are tested against the firewall rules to see if it should be allowed through</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>To provide a Host Based Firewall, the Linux kernel includes support for:</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:li>Netfilter - A set of hooks inside the Linux kernel that allows kernel modules to register callback functions with the network stack. A registered callback function is then called back for every packet that traverses the respective hook within the network stack.  Includes the ip_tables, ip6_tables, arp_tables, and ebtables kernel modules. These modules are some of the significant parts of the Netfilter hook system.</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>
nftables - A subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network packets/datagrams/frames. nftables is supposed to replace certain parts of Netfilter, while keeping and reusing most of it. nftables utilizes the building blocks of the Netfilter infrastructure, such as the existing hooks into the networking stack, connection tracking system, userspace queueing component, and logging subsystem.            <xhtml:em>Is available in Linux kernels 3.13 and newer</xhtml:em>
.        </xhtml:li>
         </xhtml:ul>
         <xhtml:p>In order to configure firewall rules for Netfilter or nftables, a firewall utility needs to be installed.  Guidance has been included for the following firewall utilities:</xhtml:p>

UncomplicatedFirewall (ufw) - Provides firewall features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the iptables backend.            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ufw</xhtml:span>
 supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks        </xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>nftables - Includes the nft utility for configuration of the nftables subsystem of the Linux kernel</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>iptables - Includes the iptables, ip6tables, arptables and ebtables utilities for configuration Netfilter and the ip_tables, ip6_tables, arp_tables, and ebtables kernel modules.</xhtml:li>
         </xhtml:ul>
         <xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>

         <xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:li>
Only           <xhtml:strong>one</xhtml:strong>

            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>If Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) or iptables are being used in your environment, please follow the guidance in their respective section and pass-over the guidance in this section.</xhtml:strong>
            </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>nftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network packets/datagrams/frames and is the successor to iptables.  The biggest change with the successor nftables is its simplicity. With iptables, we have to configure every single rule and use the syntax which can be compared with normal commands.  With nftables, the simpler syntax, much like BPF (Berkely Packet Filter) means shorter lines and less repetition.  Support for nftables should also be compiled into the kernel, together with the related nftables modules. Please ensure that your kernel supports nf_tables before choosing this option.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>
            </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>This section broadly assumes starting with an empty nftables firewall ruleset (established by flushing the rules with nft flush ruleset).</xhtml:li>

               <xhtml:p>Iptables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IP packet filter rules in the Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined. Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches. This is called a 'target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table.</xhtml:p>

 This section broadly assumes starting with an empty IPtables firewall ruleset (established by flushing the rules with iptables -F). Remediation steps included only affect the live system, you will also need to configure your default firewall configuration to apply on boot. Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run and tested before saving to boot. The following script will implement the firewall rules of this section and open port 22(ssh) from anywhere:          </xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Ip6tables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv6 packet filter rules in the Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined. Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.
Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches. This is called a `target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>If IPv6 in enabled on the system, the ip6tables should be configured.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>
 This section broadly assumes starting with an empty ip6tables firewall ruleset (established by flushing the rules with ip6tables -F). Remediation steps included only affect the live system, you will also need to configure your default firewall configuration to apply on boot. Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run and tested before saving to boot.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The following script will implement the firewall rules of this section and open port 22(ssh) from anywhere:</xhtml:p>

Secure Shell (SSH) is a secure, encrypted replacement for common login services such as           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">telnet</xhtml:span>
,           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ftp</xhtml:span>
,           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rlogin</xhtml:span>
,           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsh</xhtml:span>
, and           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rcp</xhtml:span>
. It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login protocols and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of sensitive data off the network.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>
            </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
The recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed on the system,             <xhtml:strong>if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be removed and this section skipped</xhtml:strong>
.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
The openSSH daemon configuration directives,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Include</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Match</xhtml:span>
, may cause the audits in this section's recommendations to report incorrectly. It is recommended that these options only be used if they're needed and fully understood. If these options are configured in accordance with local site policy, they should be accounted for when following the recommendations in this section.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
The default             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Include</xhtml:span>
 location is the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d</xhtml:span>
 directory. This default has been accounted for in this section. If a file has an additional             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Include</xhtml:span>
 that isn't this default location, the files should be reviewed to verify that the recommended setting is not being over-ridden.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
The audits of the running configuration in this section are run in the context of the root user, the local host name, and the local host's IP address. If a             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Match</xhtml:span>
 block exists that matches one of these criteria, the output of the audit will be from the match block. The respective matched criteria should be replaced with a non-matching substitution.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Include</xhtml:span>

                     <xhtml:li>Introduces a conditional block. If all of the criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the keywords on the following lines override those set in the global section of the config file, until either another Match line or the end of the file. If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that are satisfied, only the first instance of the keyword is applied.</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>The arguments to Match are one or more criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which matches all criteria. The available criteria are User, Group, Host, LocalAddress, LocalPort, and Address.</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>The match patterns may consist of single entries or comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators described in the PATTERNS section of ssh_config(5).</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
The patterns in an Address criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen format, such as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">192.0.2.0/24</xhtml:span>
 or                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">2001:db8::/32</xhtml:span>
.  Note that the mask length provided must be consistent with the address - it is an error to specify a mask length that is too long for the address or one with bits set in this host portion of the address. For example,                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">192.0.2.0/33</xhtml:span>
 and                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">192.0.2.0/8</xhtml:span>
, respectively.              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines following a Match keyword. Available keywords are available in the ssh_config man page.</xhtml:li>

               </xhtml:li>

Once all configuration changes have been made to             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</xhtml:span>
 or any included configuration files, the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sshd</xhtml:span>

 To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">8.2p1</xhtml:span>
 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">8.2p1</xhtml:span>
 and thus it can no longer be abused disconnect idle users.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
The two options             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.              </xhtml:p>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
 Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session.  It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en‐abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.
The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.              </xhtml:p>

In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
. Specifically, looking at the source code,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
 must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinitely, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network timeouts and apply as appropriate.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pam-auth-update</xhtml:span>
 is a utility that permits configuring the central authentication policy for the system using pre-defined profiles as supplied by PAM  module  packages.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
Profiles - Shipped in the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/usr/share/pam-configs/</xhtml:span>
 directory specify the modules, with options, to enable; the preferred ordering with respect to other profiles; and whether a profile should be enabled by default. Packages providing PAM modules register their profiles at install time by calling pam-auth-update --package.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
Selection of profiles is done using the standard             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">debconf</xhtml:span>
 interface. The profile selection question will be asked at             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">medium</xhtml:span>
 priority when packages are added or removed, so no user interaction is required by default. Users may invoke             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pam-auth-update</xhtml:span>
 directly to change their authentication configuration.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pam-auth-update</xhtml:span>
 script makes every effort to respect local changes to             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/pam.d/common-*.</xhtml:span>
 Local modifications to the list of module options will be preserved, and additions of modules within the managed portion of the stack will cause pam-auth-update to treat the config files as locally modified and not make further changes to the config files unless given the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">--force</xhtml:span>
 option.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
If the user specifies that             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pam-auth-update</xhtml:span>
 should override local configuration changes, the locally-modified files will be saved in /etc/pam.d/ with a suffix of             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">.pam-old</xhtml:span>
.          </xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pam_unix</xhtml:span>
 is the standard Unix authentication module. It uses standard calls from the system's libraries to retrieve and set account information as well as authentication. Usually this is obtained from the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/passwd</xhtml:span>
 and if shadow is enabled, the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/shadow</xhtml:span>
 file as well.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
The account component performs the task of establishing the status of the user's account and password based on the following shadow elements:               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">expire</xhtml:span>
,               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">last_change</xhtml:span>

,               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">warn_change</xhtml:span>
. In the case of the latter, it may offer advice to the user on changing their password or, through the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">PAM_AUTHTOKEN_REQD</xhtml:span>
 return, delay giving service to the user until they have established a new password. The entries listed above are documented in the shadow(5) manual page. Should the user's record not contain one or more of these entries, the corresponding shadow check is not performed.            </xhtml:p>

 - Only track failed user authentications attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP, etc.) users. The faillock(8) command will also no longer track user failed authentication attempts. Enabling this option will prevent a double-lockout scenario where a user is locked out locally and in the centralized mechanism.              </xhtml:li>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">unlock_time=n</xhtml:span>
 - The access will be re-enabled after n seconds after the lock out. The value 0 has the same meaning as value never - the access will not be re-enabled without resetting the faillock entries by the faillock(8) command. The default is 600 (10 minutes). Note that the default directory that pam_faillock uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be also re-enabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally directory must be set with the dir option. Also note that it is usually undesirable to permanently lock out users as they can become easily a target of denial of service attack unless the usernames are random and kept secret to potential attackers.              </xhtml:li>

                  <xhtml:p>These checks are configurable by either:</xhtml:p>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">difok</xhtml:span>
 - Number of characters in the new password that must not be present in the old password. (default 1). The special value of 0 disables all checks of similarity of the new password with the old password except the new password being exactly the same as the old one.              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">minlen</xhtml:span>
 - Minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if credits are not disabled which is the default). (See pam_pwquality(8).) Cannot be set to lower value than 6. (default 8)              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">dcredit</xhtml:span>
 - The maximum credit for having digits in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of digits in the new password. (default 0)              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ucredit</xhtml:span>
 - The maximum credit for having uppercase characters in the new password.  If less than 0 it is the minimum number of uppercase characters in the new password. (default 0)              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">lcredit</xhtml:span>

                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ocredit</xhtml:span>

                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">minclass</xhtml:span>
 - The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new password (digits, uppercase, lowercase, others). (default 0)              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">maxrepeat</xhtml:span>
 - The maximum number of allowed same consecutive characters in the new password.  The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0)              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">maxsequence</xhtml:span>
 - The maximum length of monotonic character sequences in the new password.  Examples of such sequence are '12345' or 'fedcb'. Note that most such passwords will not pass the simplicity check unless the sequence is only a minor part of the password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0)              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">maxclassrepeat</xhtml:span>
 - The maximum number of allowed consecutive characters of the same class in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0)              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">gecoscheck</xhtml:span>
 - If nonzero, check whether the words longer than 3 characters from the GECOS field of the user's passwd(5) entry are contained in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0)              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">dictcheck</xhtml:span>
 - If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications) matches a word in a dictionary. Currently the dictionary check is performed
using the cracklib library. (default 1)              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">usercheck=&lt;N&gt;</xhtml:span>
 - If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications) contains the user name in some form. It is not performed for user names
shorter than 3 characters. (default 1)              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">usersubstr=&lt;N&gt;</xhtml:span>
 - If greater than 3 (due to the minimum length in usercheck), check whether the password contains a substring of at least N length in some form.
(default 0)              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">enforcing=&lt;N&gt;</xhtml:span>
 - If nonzero, reject the password if it fails the checks, otherwise only print the warning. This setting applies only to the pam_pwquality module
and possibly other applications that explicitly change their behavior based on it. It does not affect pwmake(1) and pwscore(1). (default 1)              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">badwords</xhtml:span>
 - Space separated list of words that must not be contained in the password. These are additional words to the cracklib dictionary check. This setting can be also used by applications to emulate the gecos check for user accounts that are not created yet.              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">dictpath</xhtml:span>
 - Path to the cracklib dictionaries. Default is to use the cracklib default.              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">retry=&lt;N&gt;</xhtml:span>
 - Prompt user at most N times before returning with error. The default is 1.              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">enforce_for_root</xhtml:span>
 - The module will return error on failed check even if the user changing the password is root. This option is off by default which means that just the message about the failed check is printed but root can change the password anyway. Note that root is not asked for an old password so the checks that compare the old and new password are not performed.              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">local_users_only</xhtml:span>
 - The module will not test the password quality for users that are not present in the /etc/passwd file. The module still asks for the password so the following modules in the stack can use the use_authtok option. This option is off by default.              </xhtml:li>

                              <xhtml:p>In general, it is true that longer passwords are better (harder to crack), but it is also true that forced password length requirements can cause user behavior that is predictable and undesirable. For example, requiring users to have a minimum 16-character password may cause them to choose repeating patterns like fourfourfourfour or passwordpassword that meet the requirement but aren’t hard to guess. Additionally, length requirements increase the chances that users will adopt other insecure practices, like writing them down, re-using them or storing them unencrypted in their documents.</xhtml:p>
                              <xhtml:p>Having a reasonable minimum length with no maximum character limit increases the resulting
average password length used (and therefore the strength).6</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:p>Forcing users to choose an excessively complex password, e.g. some combination of upper-case, lower-case, numbers, and special characters, has a negative impact. It places an extra burden on users and many will use predictable patterns (for example, a capital letter in the first position, followed by lowercase letters, then one or two numbers, and a “special character” at the end). Attackers know this, so dictionary attacks will often contain these common patterns and use the most common substitutions like, $ for s, @ for a, 1 for l, 0 for o.</xhtml:p>

The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pam_unix.so</xhtml:span>
 module is the standard Unix authentication module. It uses standard calls from the system's libraries to retrieve and set account information as well as authentication. Usually this is obtained from the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/passwd</xhtml:span>
 and the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/shadow</xhtml:span>

                  <xhtml:p>The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the age of the password.

                  <xhtml:p>We recommend a yearly password change. This is primarily because for all their good intentions users will share credentials across accounts.

The user file-creation mode mask (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
) is used to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rwxrwxrwx</xhtml:span>
), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rw-rw-rw-</xhtml:span>
). The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 are cleared in the resulting file mode.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>

 (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 0027</xhtml:span>
 or                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 027</xhtml:span>
.  If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively.              </xhtml:li>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Symbolic</xhtml:span>

.  The permissions listed are not masked by                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
. ie a                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 set by                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask u=rwx,g=rx,o=</xhtml:span>
 is the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Symbolic</xhtml:span>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 027</xhtml:span>
.  This                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 would set a newly created directory with file mode                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">drwxr-x---</xhtml:span>

The user file-creation mode mask (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
) is used to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rwxrwxrwx</xhtml:span>
), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rw-rw-rw-</xhtml:span>
). The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 are cleared in the resulting file mode.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>

 (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 0027</xhtml:span>
 or                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 027</xhtml:span>
.  If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively.              </xhtml:li>

.  The permissions listed are not masked by                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
. ie a                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 set by                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask u=rwx,g=rx,o=</xhtml:span>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 027</xhtml:span>
.  This                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 would set a newly created directory with file mode                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">drwxr-x---</xhtml:span>
 and a newly created file with file mode                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rw-r-----</xhtml:span>

      <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
         <xhtml:p>The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing, using tools included in most distributions.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>
It is recommended that         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog </xhtml:span>
be used for logging (with         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">logwatch </xhtml:span>
providing summarization) and         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditd</xhtml:span>
 be used for auditing (with         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aureport </xhtml:span>
providing summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior.      </xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>
Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. Reference &lt;        <xhtml:a href="http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/">http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/</xhtml:a>
&gt; manual page for more information on configuring chrony.      </xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:strong>Note on log file permissions:</xhtml:strong>
 There really isn't a "one size fits all" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as "wheel" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:root 600</xhtml:span>
). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:securegrp 640 </xhtml:span>
where         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">securegrp</xhtml:span>
 is the defined security group (in some cases         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">wheel</xhtml:span>
).      </xhtml:p>

This section will cover the minimum best practices for the usage of           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>

If your organization makes use of another logging system such as             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 or an enterprise wide logging system completely outside of             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
, then the following recommendations do not directly apply. However, the principals of the recommendations should be followed regardless of what solution is implemented. If the enterprise solution incorporates             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
, careful consideration should be given to the following recommendations to determine exactly what applies.          </xhtml:li>

Enterprise logging systems not utilizing             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>

Transport layer security should be applied to all remote logging functionality.             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
 supports secure transport and should be configured as such.          </xhtml:li>

         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>
The Linux Auditing System operates on a set of rules that collects certain types of system activity to facilitate incident investigation, detect unauthorized access or modification of data.  By default events will be logged to           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit/audit.log</xhtml:span>
, which can be configured in           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/auditd.conf</xhtml:span>
.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The following types of audit rules can be specified:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>Control rules: Configuration of the auditing system.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>File system rules: Allow the auditing of access to a particular file or a directory. Also known as file watches.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>System call rules: Allow logging of system calls that any specified program makes.</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>Audit rules can be set:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
On the command line using the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditctl</xhtml:span>
 utility. These rules are not persistent across reboots.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
In             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/audit.rules</xhtml:span>
. These rules have to be merged and loaded before they are active.          </xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>Notes:</xhtml:strong>
            </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
For 64 bit systems that have             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">arch</xhtml:span>
 as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems calls. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
If the auditing system is configured to be locked (            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">-e 2</xhtml:span>
), a system reboot will be required in order to load any changes.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Key names are optional on the rules and will not be used as a compliance auditing. The usage of key names is highly recommended as it facilitates organisation and searching, as such, all remediation steps will have key names supplied.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
It is best practice to store the rules, in number prepended files, in             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/rules.d/</xhtml:span>
. Rules must end in a             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">.rules</xhtml:span>
 suffix. This then requires the use of             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">augenrules</xhtml:span>
 to merge all the rules into             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/audit.rules</xhtml:span>
 based on their their alphabetical (lexical) sort order. All benchmark recommendations follow this best practice for remediation, specifically using the prefix of             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">50</xhtml:span>
 which is centre weighed if all rule sets make use of the number prepending naming convention.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Your system may have been customized to change the default             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">UID_MIN</xhtml:span>
. All samples output uses             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">1000</xhtml:span>
, but this value will not be used in compliance auditing. To confirm the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">UID_MIN</xhtml:span>
 for your system, run the following command:             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs</xhtml:span>
               </xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:h4>Normalization</xhtml:h4>
            <xhtml:p>The Audit system normalizes some entries, so when you look at the sample output keep in mind that:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
With regards to users whose login UID is not set, the values             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">-1</xhtml:span>
 /             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">unset</xhtml:span>
 /             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">4294967295</xhtml:span>
 are equivalent and normalized to             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">-1</xhtml:span>
.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
When comparing field types and both sides of the comparison is valid fields types, such as            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">euid!=uid</xhtml:span>
, then the auditing system may normalize such that the output is             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">uid!=euid</xhtml:span>
.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Some parts of the rule may be rearranged whilst others are dependant on previous syntax. For example, the following two statements are the same:</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:code class="code_block">-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F auid!=-1 -F key=user_emulation
</xhtml:code>
            <xhtml:p>and</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:code class="code_block">-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -S execve -k user_emulation
</xhtml:code>
            <xhtml:h4>Capacity planning</xhtml:h4>
            <xhtml:p>The recommendations in this section implement auditing policies that not only produces large quantities of logged data, but may also negatively impact system performance. Capacity planning is critical in order not to adversely impact production environments.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>Disk space. If a significantly large set of events are captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated. If the logs are not sent to a remote log server, ensure that log rotation is implemented else the disk will fill up and the system will halt. Even when logs are sent to a log server, ensure sufficient disk space to allow caching of logs in the case of temporary network outages.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Disk IO. It is not just the amount of data collected that should be considered, but the rate at which logs are generated.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>CPU overhead. System call rules might incur considerable CPU overhead. Test the systems open/close syscalls per second with and without the rules to gauge the impact of the rules.</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>

For performance (                <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man 7 audit.rules</xhtml:span>
) reasons it is preferable to have all the system calls on one line. However, your configuration may have them on one line each or some other combination.

                     <xhtml:p>
For performance (                <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man 7 audit.rules</xhtml:span>
) reasons it is preferable to have all the system calls on one line. However, your configuration may have them on one line each or some other combination. This is important to understand for both the auditing and remediation sections as the examples given are optimized for performance as per the man page.              </xhtml:p>

Monitoring system events that change network environments, such as               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sethostname</xhtml:span>
 and               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">setdomainname</xhtml:span>
, helps identify unauthorized alterations to host and domain names, which could compromise security settings reliant on these names. Changes to               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/hosts</xhtml:span>
 can signal unauthorized attempts to alter machine associations with IP addresses, potentially redirecting users and processes to unintended destinations. Surveillance of               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/issue</xhtml:span>
 and               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/issue.net</xhtml:span>
 is crucial to detect intruders inserting false information to deceive users. Monitoring               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/network/</xhtml:span>
 reveals modifications to network interfaces or scripts that may jeopardize system availability or security. Additionally, tracking changes in the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/netplan/</xhtml:span>
 directory ensures swift detection of unauthorized adjustments to network configurations. All audit records should be appropriately tagged for relevance            </xhtml:p>

For performance (                <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man 7 audit.rules</xhtml:span>
) reasons it is preferable to have all the system calls on one line. However, your configuration may have them on one line each or some other combination. This is important to understand for both the auditing and remediation sections as the examples given are optimized for performance as per the man page.              </xhtml:p>

For performance (                <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man 7 audit.rules</xhtml:span>

It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount</xhtml:span>
 file systems to the system. While tracking               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount</xhtml:span>
 commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">open</xhtml:span>
,               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">creat</xhtml:span>
 and               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">truncate</xhtml:span>
 system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.            </xhtml:p>

The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/passwd</xhtml:span>
 file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/passwd</xhtml:span>
 file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/passwd</xhtml:span>
 file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/passwd</xhtml:span>
 file to             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/shadow</xhtml:span>
. The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/shadow</xhtml:span>
 file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack.          </xhtml:p>
